# Experiments in Python

This repo contains a collection of Python scripts for personal reference
only, but you are free to use as you wish, at your own risk.

The code was written for Python 3 trying to use best
practices but does not necessarily represent the best way of doing
something, YMMV; it is not guaranteed to work either.
